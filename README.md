Objective-JavaScript. To the limits.


#### Doing

* Create user friendly test cases
    + Lovely ascii art for SuperclassValues

* Class goodies
    + Automatic getter setter generation
    + Automatic enumerators for collections

0.1.1

    + Stable
        + All tests are passing
    + Started to factor helpers into an EPPZ object
        + With some alias defined on Window object
    + Class method super calls are just fine as well


0.1.0

    + Fixed return values from super proxies
    + Class method _superClass pointers are misaligned

0.0.9

    + Added awesome super getter

0.0.8

    + Best approach so far
        + Partly factored back to 'extend'
        + Only super calls have to be centralized
        + Now its all wrapped up into a function

0.0.7

    + Another working sketch

0.0.6

    + Super calls are now working
        + Really sketched on client side, needs to be factored back to 'extend'

0.0.5

    + Factoring
        + Equipment is done from one implementation object

0.0.4

    + Misspelling gone

0.0.3

    + Some wording (actually not works yet)

0.0.2

    + Hooked in 'super' method calls with correct 'this' reference within.

0.0.1

    + Class inheritance done
